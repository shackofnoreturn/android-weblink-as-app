# Android Weblink as App
 A simple Android application which opens a predefined URL in the default browser of the device.
 
This need arrose when using my Meta Quest 3. It bugs me the default browser is the best browser the meta quest has.
At the same time it lacks a ton of features like setting a homepage of your choosing or the well known "add to homepage" widget feature. 
I wanted to set my homepage to a locally hosted homepage service.
So as a workaround you now can open an app which immediatly goes to that link!

** Be warned you have to use SideQuest if you're also looking for something similar.
Otherwise you won't be able to install straight from an .apk file!**
